# DialMonkey ðŸ™Š

Minimalistic platform for dialogue system implementations.

# Installation

Clone the repo and `pip install -r requirements.txt`
The code is written in Python 3.

To use dialmonkey as a set of libraries (e.g. import packages from it), you can
do an in-place install of the cloned repo:
```
cd dialmonkey; pip install [--user] -e .
```
Use `--user` to install into your user directories (recommended unless you're using a virtualenv or conda).


# Usage

The platform is based on the configuration file.
An example of such file can be found in the `conf/` directory.

To implement your pipeline, create new YAML file in the `conf/` directory and then run
`python run_dialmonkey.py --conf conf/your_pipeline.yaml`

Essential part of the configuration is the `components` list.
You should provide one or more components that chain up to form your desired pipeline.

Each component has to inherit from the abstract class
`dialmonkey.component.Component` and be located under one of the subdirectories in the `dialmonkey/` directory  for readability
(e.g. NLU components should go under `dialmonkey/nlu/`).
Components also need to implement `__call__()` method which takes a dialogue object, does the work and returns the modified dialogue.

The `Dialogue` object can be used as a mode of communication between components.
The object supports dictionary-like indexing and you can add your own attributes.
However, there are certain attributes that are mandatory and has to be present.
Namely:
 - `dialogue['user']`: User utterance, this attribute will be set for you. You should not need to modify it.
 - `dialogue['system']`: Can be set via `Dialogue.set_system_response()`. It is mandatory to set this attribute at each turn in one of your components.
 - `dialogue['nlu']`: A dictionary of NLU annotation, doesn't have to be used.
 - `dialogue['state']'`: A dictionary representing the dialogue state, should be used to keep the persistent values.
 
Do not forget to call `Dialogue.end_dialogue()` at some point.

Each run will create a JSON file with the history of all the conversations.
You can specify this file in configuration.

Have fun!
